<h3>About the project...</h3>
<p>
 I developed a dynamic speed test application by actively using redux-toolkit, a large library, and applying state management in all components. Correctly entered words turn green, incorrectly entered words turn red. Each word entered within the given time is counted as correct or incorrect. When the given time expires, the result component appears on the screen and the percentage is calculated based on the number of keyboard presses, the number of correct words, the number of incorrect words and the total number of words clicked.
