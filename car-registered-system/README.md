<h3>About the project...</h3>
<p>
 
Hello, in this project I frequently communicated between React components. I thoroughly understood React's presentation. I used functions such as useMemo and useCallBack depending on whether there was unnecessary rendering or not. I used formik and yup for form management. I used react router dom for page redirects. I actively ensured interactive communication between state and components by providing state management with Redux.
